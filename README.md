# OhMyDog

OhMyDog is an app developed as part of an initiative to improve the living conditions of animals across the world. As a 100% non-profit
project, OhMyDog directs all of its ad revenue towards enabling our volunteers to shelter, feed, and take care of animals in need.

As an app, OhMyDog teaches its users some really cool animal facts(!), all while generating ad-revenue for a great cause. Additionally, 
users can accumulate coins that they can spend on digital food and water, medication, or adoption that our (future) sponsors and
volunteers will work to match in the real world.
